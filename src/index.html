    <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
    <p>I currently work as a Software Developer for GE Digital. I just started this career in November 2016 after a 13 year career as a teacher. I decided to make a career change after I discovered my love of programming and web design through teaching others and working on personal projects. I am passionate about creating cool websites and applications where I can showcase my creativity.

    Last summer, I attended a 10-week Front End Developer Bootcamp at Grand Circus in downtown Detroit. Over the course of the 10 weeks, I completed coursework using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SASS, jQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS among others! Although the bootcamp was very intensive, I learned a lot about my resilience and my ability to push through challenges.

    In addition to programming, I love all things music. I have been singing since I was 5 years old and I also play the trumpet, french horn, harp, piano, and guitar. Music is an outlet for me to be expressive and free.</p>
